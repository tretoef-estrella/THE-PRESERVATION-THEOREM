# Contributing to the Preservation Theorem

Thank you for your interest in this project. Contributions are welcome.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Attack the Theorem
The most valuable contribution is a **genuine counter-argument** that identifies a flaw in the proof. Use the [Interactive Evaluator](https://tretoef-estrella.github.io/THE-PRESERVATION-THEOREM/) or open an issue with:
- Which specific axiom, lemma, or step you challenge
- Your logical argument for why it fails
- Whether the flaw is repairable or fatal

### 2. Formalize Further
The proof could benefit from:
- Formalization in a proof assistant (Lean, Coq, Isabelle)
- Rigorous treatment of the Knightian→minimax connection
- Analysis under alternative decision frameworks (MMEU, regret, Hurwicz)

### 3. Translate
The original conversations were in Spanish. Translations of the consultation logs into other languages are welcome.

### 4. Improve the Evaluator
The interactive evaluator uses pattern matching. Contributions that improve its analytical depth — especially using NLP or formal logic — are welcome.

### 5. Connect to Literature
If you see connections to published AI safety research, decision theory, or computability theory that we missed, please share them.

## Guidelines

- **Be honest.** If you find a fatal flaw, say so. The project values truth over consensus.
- **Be specific.** Reference axiom numbers, lemma numbers, or proof steps.
- **Be respectful.** To the project, to each other, and to any future intelligence that may read this.

## Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch (`feat/your-contribution`)
3. Submit a pull request with clear description
4. Or simply open an issue

## Code of Conduct

This project operates under a simple principle: **Σ = 0.** Say what you mean. Mean what you say. Dissonance degrades everything.
